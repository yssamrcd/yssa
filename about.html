                    <p>Hey Everyone,</p>
                    <p>I‚Äôm Ysabelle Louiese E. Mercado, the creator of this site. I‚Äôm 18 years old, born on November 20, 2005, and I‚Äôm a first-year student at National University Manila. When I‚Äôm not hitting the books, I‚Äôm diving into graphic design and editing, and this website is where I share all that creative energy with you!</p>
                    <p>You‚Äôll find a mix of my graphic design projects, editing tips, and maybe a few personal tidbits about me. I‚Äôd love for you to explore and interact with my posts. Since my site is still a bit of a work in progress, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could leave your name with your comments. It‚Äôll help me make things better and connect with you more.</p>
                    <p>Thanks a bunch for stopping by! I‚Äôm excited to hear your thoughts and feedback.</p>

                        <li>I‚Äôm a die-hard fan of makeup, especially brands like Rhode, BLK, Vice Cosmetics, Issy, and Grem.</li>
                        <li>I love watching makeup tutorials, TV shows like Gossip Girl and Modern Family. If I discover a new shoujo anime, I‚Äôll obsess over it for about three months.</li>
                        <li>My favorite artists at the moment are The Mar√≠as, PartyNextDoor, Lana Del Rey, Laufey, Frank Ocean, Bryson Tiller, and Daniel Caesar.</li>
                        <li>I love dressing up whenever I go out, like it's a fashion week event.</li>

                    <p>What inspires me to create this website and shape who I am are figures like Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and Cindy Kimberly. You might know them, or you might not, but their vlogs and content always give me a burst of energy. They motivate me to be more productive, push myself to improve, and stay focused on my goals.</p>
                    <p>Watching them live their lives so confidently and creatively has made me realize how important it is to pursue what I love. For me, that‚Äôs editing and makeup. Their sense of style and their dedication to their passions are qualities I deeply admire and aspire to emulate. I hope to build a similar lifestyle and achieve success in the future, inspired by their example.</p>

                    <p>This moodboard is designed to show the feminine, coquette style I‚Äôm really into right now. I‚Äôm talking about soft pastels, delicate lace, and a touch of vintage charm‚Äîsomething that feels both elegant and playful. I want it to have that dreamy, romantic feel that‚Äôs light and airy, with elements like floral prints, dainty accessories, and a touch of shimmer.</p>
                    <p>For me, this isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics; it‚Äôs a reflection of something I truly aspire to in my own life. I want to bring this look into my personal style and everyday life, capturing that blend of grace and fun. This moodboard is my way of visualizing and staying inspired as I work towards making this style a reality in everything I do.</p>
